The "Kinetic Sculpture" metaphorically translates into space the form-finding process of vehicle design. The interplay of mechanical and electronic components creates a dynamic art piece reflecting the precise exchange between a great number of individual elements and the single, coherent picture that emerges from them. 
Attached by thin steel wires to individually-controlled stepper motors, 714 metal spheres move up and down, seemingly levitating.
