Body Mnemonics is an interface design concept for portable devices that uses the body space of the user as an interface. In this system information can be stored and subsequently accessed by moving a device to different locations around one’s body. The system is designed to ease cognitive load by relying on our proprioceptive sense, vibrotactile feedback, and the use of the body image of the user as a mnemonic frame of reference. Feedback from interviews conducted while developing this system suggests that the body view is a very personal artefact and that it is rich in meaning. It therefore has the potential to serve as a powerful memory aid.
