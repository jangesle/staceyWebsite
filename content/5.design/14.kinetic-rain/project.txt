Kinetic Rain is an artwork at Terminal 1 in Singapore’s Changi Airport, adding a contemplative element to the lively transit space of the departure hall.

It consists of two parts installed above the central escalators. Each symmetrical element is composed of 608 drops made of lightweight aluminium covered with copper. The drops are connected by steel wires to a computer-controlled motor that raises and lowers them with precision.

The two elements move in dialogue through a fifteen-minute choreographed piece, evolving from abstract to figurative three-dimensional forms. Kinetic Rain can be seen from above, below and all sides. The visual experience of the complex computer-designed movement is completely different depending on perspective.

Kinetic Rain was commissioned by Changi Airport Group Singapore and the installation was manufactured and installed by MKT, Olching.
