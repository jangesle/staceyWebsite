content: 

Professor Jussi Ängeslevä is a designer, an artist and an educator. With home base at the Berlin University of the Arts and Royal college of Arts in London, but lecturing around the planet, he is actively involved in the ever expanding field of new media, working with digital materiality and interaction design. In parallel to the academic work, he is the Vice Creative Director of ART+COM studios, where his work in public art commissions, exhibitions and installations are consistently yielding international recognition. 

His independent works have been awarded by institutions such as Royal Society of Arts, NESTA, Art Directors Club of Europe, D&AD, Ars Electronica and ZKM. Over the years he has served in numerous international art and design juries, academic chairs and boards. Throughout his career his focus has always been intentionally in between fields: combining understanding of visual, physical and interaction design with algorithmic, electronic and mechatronic knowledge to create innovative and elegant experiences.

His design ethos is leveraging hardware, software, physical and graphic design in the search for elegance in highly specific solutions, where the meaning of a work is inseparable from the medium communicating it.
